# Data 4 Good Challenge (D4GC): Racial Bias in Machine Learning Algorithms in the US Justice System

### What is this?

This is our proposed solution for **D4GC 2020**, for which we won the **Best Data Insight reward**! For our submission, we created two ML models based on the Logistic Regression algorithm. One model, we trained on their "biased" predictions, and one model was our optimized version from which we left out all racial features. We observed that our model performed better, even though we left out all racial features from the dataset. On the other side, their model was heavily reliant on the characteristic like race, age, and sex, which implies that the original model has a bias in their model.

### How to recreate the experiments and how to use it? 

The final model is placed in the **D4GC.ipynb** notebook. To use it, open the file and follow the instructions.
